        <h1>Untracked file vs Tracked file</h1>
    </header>
    <!--- I choose to differentiate between untracked and tracked files. However, in my opinion, if an untracked file provides no clear benefit to the user, this distinction might not be necessary.--->
    <main>
        <p>Accessing a Sketch file on Abstract from a branch other than your current branch results in an <b>Untracked file</b> being created on the platform. 
        This happens because the file exists in the project you are working on, but it is not committed to your current branch.
        In contrast, a Sketch file that has been worked on and committed in your current branch is considered a <b>Tracked file</b>.</p>
    
        <h2>Accessing an Untracked File</h2>
        <p>On Abstract, an untracked file can only be viewed. You may find untracked files in the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Viewing a file on the main branch without creating a new branch.</li>
            <li>Viewing a file on a contributor's branch without creating your own child branch.</li>
            <li>Viewing a file from a previous commit on the main branch, a contributor's branch, or your own branch.</li>
            <li>Viewing a file in your current branch without the latest changes.</li>
            <li>Accessing a file on any branch, including the main branch, or from a previous commit, to copy and paste elements into a different file.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Viewing an Untracked File</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Abstract desktop app.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Project</b> > <b>Main</b>.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Files</b>, choose the <code>.sketch</code> file you want to view, and then select <b>Edit in Sketch</b> > <b>Open Untracked</b>.</li>
            <li>Optionally, view specific <b>Commits</b></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a commit to view. In the file preview, choose the file and then select <b>Open Untracked</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <!---I chose to combine the process of viewing untracked files, as splitting it was somewhat confusing, especially since the initial steps are the same.
            I placed the note at the end because I consider it a product 'known issue' and prefer not to distract the reader's attention at the beginning of the article.--->
        <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f39c12; background-color: #fdf5e6; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Abstract currently does not support making changes in an untracked file. To make changes, it's recommended to create a branch and commit the changes for a merge.
        </div>
    </main>
    
    <!---Additionally, if the platform adheres to the Git flow, untracked files should either be committed within a branch or result in a divergent branch.
        However, I encountered a plugin issue that prevented me from linking Sketch and Abstract, so the exact behavior remains unclear to me.-->
